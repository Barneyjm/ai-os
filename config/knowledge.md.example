# AI-OS Custom Knowledge Base
#
# Copy this file to ~/.ai-os/knowledge.md to customize the agent's knowledge.
# Or set AI_KNOWLEDGE_PATH environment variable to point to your file.
#
# This file is included in the system prompt, so the agent will use this
# information when making decisions. Add your own:
# - Server-specific procedures
# - Custom application knowledge
# - Site-specific conventions
# - Troubleshooting tips for your environment

## My Environment

# Example: Document your specific setup
# - Web server: nginx on port 8080 (behind cloudflare)
# - Database: PostgreSQL 15 on localhost:5432
# - App: Python/FastAPI in /opt/myapp, managed by systemd unit myapp.service
# - Backups: Daily to /mnt/backup at 2am via cron

## Custom Procedures

### Deploying Updates
# 1. Pull latest: cd /opt/myapp && git pull
# 2. Install deps: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. Run migrations: python manage.py migrate
# 4. Restart: systemctl restart myapp

### When Disk Gets Full
# Priority cleanup order:
# 1. /var/log/myapp/*.log.* (old rotated logs)
# 2. /tmp/uploads older than 7 days
# 3. Docker images: docker system prune

## Known Issues

### myapp high memory
# This app has a known memory leak. If it exceeds 2GB:
# 1. Check /var/log/myapp/app.log for errors
# 2. Restart is safe during off-hours
# 3. During business hours, alert on-call first

### nginx 502 errors
# Usually means myapp is down or overloaded:
# 1. Check: systemctl status myapp
# 2. Check: journalctl -u myapp -n 50
# 3. If OOM killed, increase memory limit and restart
